# Chatbot Implementation

## Overview
This Python project uses a GPT-powered chatbot to collect feedback in a friendly and human-readable way, as an improvement over current and common survey and form methods. It uses proprietary credentials from ZEISS and should therefore not be widely used. Therefore, it has been set to Private.

## Functionality
- **Chat cunctionality**: Engages users and provides responses based on their input.
- **Azure integration**: Securely manages credentials using Azure services.
- **Data storage**: Stores data in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
